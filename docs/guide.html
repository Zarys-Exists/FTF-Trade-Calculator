            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This site is a basic trade calculator to check the value of your potential FTF trades. It's useful for those who 
                either do not have a good grasp of values or those who would like to speed up their trade calculations. 
                Read the instructions below to understand its features and nuances. Despite my best efforts, 
                it may not be entirely intuitive—any feedback is welcome and appreciated.</p>

            <h2>Use Guide</h2>
            <p>I will not be going over the simple aspects of the site (click the item and it gets added, yay!). 
                Instead, I will explain the more unintuitive aspects:</p>
            
            <ul class="guide-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Value Source:</strong> All values displayed on this site come from the <a href="https://ftf-values.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official FTF values website</a> 
                    and are updated shortly after each value list update. Please note, however, that the site does not account for item demand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Value:</strong> The total value you're offering in a trade is displayed at the top left, 
                    and the value given by the other trader is displayed at the top right. The difference between both values is given in the middle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Set/Broken:</strong> Items are by default added to the calculator as a set and will have 
                    the set value as per the value list. This can be changed by clicking the 'H' or 'G' button while choosing the item, 
                    which will make the site consider it as a hammer or gem respectively and show the appropriate value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>H/G ratio:</strong> The value of a broken (h/g) item is dependent on a few factors, 
                    including its rarity. For legendaries, the value of a set is split with 70% to the hammer and 30% to the gem. 
                    For seasonals, it's 50/50. However, there is an exception for sets with neon gems (aurora, cherry pie, etc.), 
                    in which case the ratio is instead 20/80 for hammer/gem respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quantity Limit:</strong> The quantity of a single item is capped at 100. However, you can add the 
                    same item in the next slot if you need more than that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unit Switching:</strong> You can switch between the old (HV) and new (FV) units of value through the toggle
                    at the bottom right of the calculator. 1 HV = 40 FV
                </li>
            </ul>
